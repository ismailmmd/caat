# Test Markdown File

This is a **bold** text and this is *italic* text.

## Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

This is an inline code. Why `console.log({} == {});` is not same as `console.log({} === {});`
