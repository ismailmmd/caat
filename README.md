A modular CLI tool written in TypeScript that converts various file formats to beautifully styled terminal output with colors and formatting.

![alt text](image.png)

Why **caat**? Just like the Unix `cat` command concatenates and displays files, **caat** (Cat-like Advanced Appearance Tool) takes it a step further by elegantly displaying your files with style! üê± It's the purr-fect alternative to plain `cat` for reading various file formats - because who wants to stare at raw content when you can have rainbow-colored, properly formatted output? üåà‚ú®

- Testing and submission process
- Examples of potential parsers (JSON, CSV, YAML, etc.)

### Development Setup

**For TypeScript development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build    # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
   npm run cli      # Build and run CLI
   npm test         # Build and test with markdown file
   ```

**Test the CLI locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   node build/cli.js test.md # read markdown file using caat
   ```

### Making Changes

Follow [GitHub's open source contribution guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) for best practices.

### Release Process

1. **Update version and push**:
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch  # for bug fixes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   npm run release:minor  # for new features (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
   npm run release:major  # for breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub release**:
   - Go to GitHub > Releases > Create a new release
   - Use the git tag created by npm version (e.g., `v1.0.2`)
   - The CI/CD pipeline will automatically use the release tag version for npm publishing
